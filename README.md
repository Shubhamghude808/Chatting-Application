# Chatting-Application
This Java Project is a robust and secure chatting application developed using Java, leveraging the power of sockets and client-server architecture.

# Key features include:
1. Socket Communication: Utilizing Java's socket functions, Chatify enables real-time messaging between clients and the server, ensuring efficient and reliable data transmission.

2. Byte Stream: Messages are transmitted as byte streams, optimizing data transfer and minimizing latency for a smooth chatting experience.

3. Multicasting: With support for multicasting, Chatify allows users to participate in group chats, facilitating communication among multiple users simultaneously.

4. Database Integration (JDBC): Integration with JDBC enables seamless storage and retrieval of chat history, ensuring that users can access their conversations across sessions.

5. Secure Messaging (Cipher text): Chatify prioritizes security by encrypting messages using advanced cipher techniques, ensuring that sensitive information remains protected during transmission.

6. Timestamps (Date): Each message is timestamped, providing users with a clear timeline of conversations and enhancing the overall user experience.


# Objective and Scope:
The aim of this project is to express how we can implement a simple chat application between   a   server   and   a   client.
The application  is  a desktop-basedapplication and  is  implemented  using  Swing  and  awt. The   project   is   developed   in   Java   SE language  executed  on  a  single  stand-alone java  across  a  network  using  loop  back address concept.

Application consists of two programs:
•Server(Person 2)
•Client(Person 1)
•Encryp-Decryp

Server(Person 2): The server module of the application waits for  the  client  to  connect  to  it.  Then  if connection   is   granted   a   client   interacts communicates and connects to the server, it can mutually communicate with the server. The  duty  of  the  server  is  to  let  clients exchange the messages.

Client(Person 1): The  client  module  is  the  one  that  utilizer sends requests to the server. Utilizer utilizes the  client  as  the  means  to  connect  to  the server. Once he establishes the connection, he   can   communicate   to   the   connected server.

Encryp-Decryp: The Encryp-Decryp module   is   used   to encrypt the data messages from one end to another using Base64 java package.
